## Want to help developing our website theme? ðŸ§°
All help is appreciated. If you find something that you find wrong, a typo or bug for instance, please open an issue over at [/issues](https://github.com/partikular/partikular.se/issues). Here you can also add feature requests you want us to take a look at. If you would like to add a feature yourself, please do so by adding a [pull request](https://github.com/partikular/partikular.se/pulls). We will then review it, and if youÂ´re lucky it will be added to our theme. Now, please read the steps below for recommended local tools and settings.

### Set up your local development environment âœ¨
- You need to be able to host a Wordpress website locally. This can be done in various ways, we like using [Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com) which is clean and simple.
- When your Wordpress sample website is up and running, `cd` into the `app/public` folder.

### Installation ðŸ“¥
- Initiate git by running the `git init` command, and clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/partikular/partikular.se.git`.
- Login to your Wordpress website, and choose Space Rings as your default theme.
